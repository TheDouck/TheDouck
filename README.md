I'm a developer from Denmark. I don't really have alot to fill my profile with at this moment.

But i like old tech, like 486s and pentiums, ooooold pentiums. Also old networking stuff and old interfaces. 

I’m collaborating with [Viktor Popp](https://github.com/ViktorPopp) on different projects and i'm also helping with the [ZeroDev](https://github.com/projectzerodev) project.

You can reach me via my email thedouckdev@gmail.com
